<i><b>How is the course going so far?</b></i>    
Project 1 dealt with creating a vignette for reading and summarizing a JSON datasets through the National Hockey League (NHL) API.  For the first several bullet points, I feel that I learned a great deal about JSON in general, its history, development, and utility.  It makes perfect sense to learn about it in a class such as this, and I can see areas of my personal and professional life where I would want to utilize JSON, R, APIs, and GitHub much more!
