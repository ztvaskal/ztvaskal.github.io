<i><b>How is the course going so far?</b></i>    
I feel like the course is going well so far!  I just received my grade on the first project assignment and I am super happy about that - especially a good feeling after all of the hours of work I put into it.  So far I am disappointed in myself about two things.  The first is the little 2 and 3 points (to 6 or 10 points) off on most every homework assignment.  These are hard to stop, although I don't feel it is the same mistake homework to homework - I'm at a loss on how to correct. The second is my grade on the first exam.  I lost 6 points total.  I had the correct answer on two and switched to incorrect, and 2 more were silly mistakes.  The other 2 I could live with.  All grading things aside, I feel like I am learning R pretty well.  I hope I can continue to use it in the future.  Dr. Post you are awesome, and I'd totally take another class with you!


<i><b>What do you like about the course and what would you change about the course?</b></i>    
I like the weekly assignments and the projects.  I don't know if there is an R certification exam like SAS, but if not maybe the exams aren't as important.  I think learning the code and the syntax is important and that seems to be best done through the assignments and project (since I can only speak to the first one so far).  And, the amount that we had to write about JSON on that project I feel like I learned so much!  Maybe there could be more blog posts, or smaller projects instead of the exams?  Just a thought.  Otherwise completely great course to learn R!


<i><b>Any other thoughts?</b></i>    
I like that we are finally getting into some things that feel more like statistics than just programming.  I mean we did some basic descriptive stuff all along, so I guess I mean more rigorous statistical ideas and procedures.  I really like and value that! I also appreciate that we do not have to data clean like we do in ST 555.  Dealing with all of the errors in the files is tedious (but useful and I appreciate that in SAS) but I am not sure I'd appreciate it as much in R, so thank you! :)  Again, awesome course you've put together Dr. Post!  Subhankar thank you for all your hard work in grading!  I know at least I don't make it super easy on you! :)

Kind regards,
Zack
