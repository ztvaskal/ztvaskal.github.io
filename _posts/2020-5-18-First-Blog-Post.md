title: Data Science versus Statistics
---

<i><b>What do you think being a data scientist is about?</b></i>

To answer this question it is necessary to first provide a working definition for data science.  There are numerous definitions, which seem to share several common components, two related sets of components I believe help to develop the broadest definition.  The first set of 3 components I most agree with is provided by Brad Schumitsch, from a blog post by Justin Megahan titled,  <a href="https://mixpanel.com/blog/2016/03/30/this-is-the-difference-between-statistics-and-data-science/"><i>This is the difference between statistics and data science</i></a> where Brad states that the "data science team (at Twitch) brings together three things: statistics, programming, and product knowledge."  Schumitsch also feels that data science is applied statistics, as he relates that "no one is writing papers that Fisher would write," but that data sceince is much more than that, and requires deep understanding in each of the three areas.

The second set of components, similar to the first, yet slightly different is depicted below in the Data Science Venn Diagram, by Drew Conway.

Here data science is described as the intersection of math and statistics knowledge, substantive expertise, and hacking skills. Therefore, combining these components, we could create a simple yet broad definition for data science as, a field of study that combines mathematical and statistical knowledge, programming skills, and industry domain and product knowledge expertise, to answer questions through meaningful insights uncovered from data.

Thus, a data scientist is much more than some wand waving Merlin or Gandalf, or what Daniel Gutierrez in a blog post titled, <a href="https://medium.com/odscjournal/data-scientists-versus-statisticians-8ea146b7a47f"><i>Data Scientists Versus Statisticians</i></a>, describes as a "21st Century Harry Houdini who effortlessly extracts insights from data."  Data scientists must often combine multiple sources of data, apply machine learning, develop models, and communicate predictions and information necessary to make important business decisions.

<i><b>What do you see as the major duties and/or knowledge areas?</b></i>

Many of the key knowledge areas were described above in the previous section, namely, a strong background in mathematics and statistics to understand algorithms and models as well as probability and inference, strong computer programming skills, and a knowledge of the discipline or corporation in order to assist in solving problems and answering questions with big data.  A blog post by Andrew Zola titled, <a href="https://www.springboard.com/blog/machine-learning-engineer-vs-data-scientist/"><i>Machine Learning Engineer vs. Data Scientist</i></a> details more key knowledge areas and some of the major duties a data scientist might be required to perform.  First, additional key knowledge areas include software programs like Java, Python, and SQL, advanced mathematical skills and statistical modelling techniques, web services like DigitalOcean or Spark, as well as the ability to analyze data from third-party sources such as Google Analytics. Second, some of the major duties related to these key areas include: researching and developing data models and algorithms, using predictive modelling to enhance business outcomes, and communicating results and statistical processes to key business stakeholders.

<i><b>What differences/similarities do you see between data scientists and statisticians?</b></i>

In many ways, I believe the similarities outweigh the differences.  Both statisticians and data scientists are using data, sometimes gathered in different ways, to answer meaningful questions.  Both should have strong analytical skills and critical thinking skills in addition to a strong background in mathematics and statistics.  Both need to communicate highly technical results to lay constituents in order to assist in making crucial decisions to move the organization or research efforts forward.  Some of the key differences have already been implicitly stated above, but we will make more explicit here.  The first difference, and perhaps the largest, is related to the depth and breadth which data scientists need to be versed in related to computer programming languages and softwares.  The second difference is related to scale and magnitude of the data involved.  Statisticians in general do not have to deal with the massive datasets that data scientists do.  The final difference is related to knowledge of the industry.  While context is always important to a statistician, the need to have a broad and deep working knowledge of the corporation or industry is not generally needed.

<i><b>How do you view yourself in relation to these two areas?</b></i>

I would like to view myself as both a statistician and data scientist, and I am hopeful with the help from my summer courses in statistics, i will be more well rounded in both areas. Certainly, right now I feel that I lean more towards the statistician vantage point, since I teach biostatistics.  However, I did major in mathematics in undergrad, with minors in computer science and physics, so the data scientist side is there as well.  Not only that but my first internship was in Institutional Research where I spent many hours cleaning, analyzing, and creating reports for campus-wide data projects.  I am very much looking forward to developing my skills in both statistics and data science throughout the course of the summer.
